The Orlando metropolitan region posted the second-highest tech employment growth rate among the nation's 30 most populous regions.\n\nThe Orlando tech workforce expanded by 2,000 jobs in 2023 and has grown by 9,500 positions over the past five years, representing a 15% increase between 2018 and 2023. This 2.8% annual growth rate outpaced tech-focused markets like Austin (2.4%), Miami (2.3%), Tampa (1.5%), and more than doubled the national average of 1.2%.\n\nOrlando's tech employment comprises workers in technology occupations (45,641) and those employed by tech companies (46,896), with software accounting for over half of tech industry employees. The sector is projected to surpass 76,000 workers in 2024.\n\nDespite the growth, significant wage disparities highlight unrealized potential. Tech workers in Orlando earn more than double the median wage across all occupations in the region, but the workforce lacks diversity. Women hold just 28% of tech positions, while Hispanic and Black workers represent only 16% and 11% respectively.\n\nThe region received a major boost in 2024 when Plug and Play, the world's premier startup accelerator, established two Orlando locations at the University of Central Florida and NeoCity in Osceola County.
